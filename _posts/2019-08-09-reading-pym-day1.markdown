I know a little about Python as a programming language (being honest here and preparing myself before I get blown) 

So,  I was suggested in DGPLUG to read the book "Python for you and me" , Or pym for short

The beginning section was really good. 
What I like about the book is that best practices are told side by side along with the programming concepts. 

Some of best practices I learnt were: 


Also,  one basic thing that I learnt just some days before reading the book was making the .py file executable.

One raging doubt I always have is how does the compiler gets to know about shebang, as # used for comments in python. 


[5 min]
Got to know about mu editor for python. 
( I only knew  about IDLE :P) 
Learnt about REPL (read evaluate print loop) 

[10 min]
Learnt about f strings and why they were included from the talk mentioned

Also learnt about tuple packing and unpacking. I had used them but didn't associate them with tuples

[5 min]
Operators and Expression section had a lot of things. The programs at the end implemented those concepts which is good.
